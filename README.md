# Dice-Game-Race-to-50
his is a simple, interactive console-based dice game where 2 to 4 players compete to reach a target score of 50. Each player takes turns rolling a six-sided die, accumulating points for each roll, but if they roll a 1, their turn ends and they lose all points accumulated during that turn.

Rolling a 1 ends the turn and the player's score for that turn is reset to 0.
Players can choose to stop rolling at any time to save their current score.
The first player to reach or exceed 50 points wins.
